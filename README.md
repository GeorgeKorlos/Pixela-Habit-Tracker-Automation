# Pixela Habit Tracker Automation

This repository contains a Python script that automates interactions with the Pixela API to track daily habits. The script allows you to create a user account, generate a graph for tracking, and add or update pixels on the graph to represent daily progress.

## Features

- **User Account Creation**: Automate the creation of a Pixela account.
- **Graph Creation**: Generate a custom graph to track specific habits (e.g., programming hours).
- **Pixel Addition**: Log daily progress by adding pixels to the graph.
- **Pixel Update**: Modify existing entries on the graph to correct or update progress.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `python-dotenv`
- A Pixela account (optional, as the script can create one for you)
- Pixela API token

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
